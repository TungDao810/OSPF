# OSPF Performance Evaluation of OpenFlow and OSPF Protocols in Private Networks

This project evaluates the performance of traditional **OSPF routing** and **OpenFlow-based SDN routing** within a private network simulation environment. The simulation is conducted using **Mininet**, a popular network emulator for rapid prototyping of SDN systems.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Compare the routing efficiency of OSPF and OpenFlow.
- Simulate real-world routing scenarios in private networks.
- Measure and analyze metrics such as packet loss rate, Travel Round Trip time, and convergence time.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Mininet** – for network topology simulation
- **OpenFlow** – for SDN-based routing
- **FRRouting** – for OSPF implementation
- **Python** – for scripting and automation
- **ping** – for performance testing

---

## 🧪 Key Features

- Custom topologies with multiple routers and hosts
- Integration of OSPF protocol via routing daemons
- OpenFlow controller setup for SDN routing
- Automated performance testing scripts
- Side-by-side comparison between OSPF and SDN paths

---

### 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.12.7
- Mininet
- FRRouting (for OSPF)
